This repository is my proposal for the ETL/ELT design for the following metrics and aggregations based on the provided src_table files:
a. General KPIs: 
	- metrics: Active Users, New Users, Revenue, Spenders(Buyers), ARPU, ARPPU, 1 Day Retention rate, 3 Day Retention rate, 7 Day Retention rate, 7 day Conversion Rate
	- period: Daily, Monthly, Weekly
	Add any additional metrics which you think will be valuable for Game performance analysis.
b. Ships saturation:
	- ships owned by a every user every day.
	- daily ships popularity
c. User transactions overview:
	- amount of battles, logins, days since registration before first purchase 
	- daily/weekly/monthly revenue per user
  d. Battle analysis
	- new users participation in battles on a 1/3/7/14 day since registration
	- battle participation by active users
